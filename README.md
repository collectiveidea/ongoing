# The Ask

> Currently my blog https://www.tbray.org/ongoing relies on a single static CSS file at https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/serif.css (Many years ago I used to offer serif and sans-serif variants of the blog).
> The blog is written in raw XML and the publishing system turns it into XHTML with reasonably good semantic markup.  If it would facilitate fixing the CSS I could update the publishing system to fine-tune the markup.
> The CSS is entirely hand-constructed by myself and is not good.  The blog mostly looks OK but I would like to achieve the following:
> 1. Have the text be readable on as wide a variety as possible as different screen sizes and shapes. Something seems to have broken recently, the text is unreadably tiny on Android.
> 2. If I put in an image that is too tall-and-narrow (I can supply an example) the text tries to wrap around it, I want images strictly in-line with the main column.
> 3. I’d like images to extend out to the left, to the edge of the screen if they’re wide enough.
> 4. If I have a header and then drop into an \<ol\> or \<ul\> without having a \<p\> after the header, the first list item gets a deformed font.
> 5. The text comes too close to the top of images (OK, I could fix that one).
> 6. I’d like anything that is hideously wrong in my current CSS replaced with something modern and good.
